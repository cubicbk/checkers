# Cubic Checkers

A simple checkerboard with components.


## Instructions:

Create a checkerboard with Angular 2+. The exact version you use is not important. Use the Angular CLI to generate the new project. Then create two new components: "checkerboard" and "square".

The "checkerboard" component will consist of 8 x 8 squares of alternating color, black and white, like a real checkerboard. Each of the 64 squares should be represented by their own instance of the "square" component.

Clicking a square should cause the relevant square to show a count of the number of times it has been clicked.

Below the checkerboard component, show a list of the ids of each square that has been clicked since the page loaded.

Use "ng serve" to make your application accessible in a local browser.

Once complete, please commit your code to a new repository and push to GitHub (or similar) for review.

Take as long as you like, except be sure to provide your finished code a full day in advance before the technical interview. You should aim to take no more than 45 minutes on this app; using much more time than this could be a sign the app is more complicated than it needs to be.
